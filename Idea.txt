Let me tell you a story. There were a group of interns who were excited to start their new adventure at a new company. However, on their first day, they were disappointed to find out that their access badges weren't ready, they wouldn't receive their laptops for a few more days, and they had no idea what they were supposed to be doing.

They spent nearly 25% of their time on onboarding activities that didn't engage them or help them build relationships with their peers. It was a frustrating and demotivating experience that left them feeling unprepared for the job they were hired to do.

We don't want any of our new interns to experience this disappointment. That's why we are introducing Frosh Week for all new interns at Bank. We want to provide you with an engaging and inclusive event that will help you connect with your peers, learn more about Bank's culture, and set you up for success from day one.




Slide 1: Idea Pitch

Title: Virtual Reality and In-Person Scavenger Hunt Game

Introduction:
We propose a new game that combines the excitement of scavenger hunts with the immersive experience of virtual reality (VR). Our game is designed to be played by teams of two, where one player will be in a virtual world and the other in the physical world.

Gameplay:
The virtual player will receive clues to find the flavor of coffee they need to make. Once they find the clue, they will pass it on to their teammate in the physical world, who will then complete the task of making the flavored coffee. The first team to complete the task wins.

Benefits:
Our game offers an exciting and unique way to engage teams, promoting teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills. It's a great way to bring together remote and in-person team members, creating a fun and interactive experience for all.

Slide 2: Feasibility of the Idea

Title: Feasibility of Virtual Reality and In-Person Scavenger Hunt Game

Introduction:
Our game combines the latest in virtual reality technology with real-world scavenger hunt gameplay. In this slide, we will discuss the feasibility of our idea and the technical requirements to make it a reality.

Virtual Reality:
Our game requires a VR headset and controllers for the virtual player. VR technology has become more accessible in recent years, and many companies offer affordable VR headsets.

Scavenger Hunt Gameplay:
The scavenger hunt aspect of the game is a tried-and-true concept that has been used in various settings, making it easy to implement in our game.

Technical Requirements:
To make the game work seamlessly, we will need a robust network and server infrastructure to ensure smooth communication between the virtual and in-person players. We will also need a well-designed app to guide the virtual player through the game and keep track of progress.

Conclusion:
Overall, we believe that our idea is both feasible and exciting. With the right technical infrastructure in place, our game has the potential to engage and entertain teams of all sizes, in both remote and in-person settings.
